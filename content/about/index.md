I’m Yordan, a head of data engineering based in Bulgaria. I build pipelines that don’t break and dashboards that make sense.
I lead data teams that support business growth and help companies make confident decisions.

These days, I'm working on an end-to-end testing strategy with dbt, GreatExpectations and Singer. Data quality and observability are extremely important in the age of AI.

I find the intersection between tech and business exciting and that's what my newsletter is about.

Outside work, I spend time with my family (I have 3 daughters), play video games and talk on the ham radio.
